To effectively stop the sharing of criminal links on platforms like Instagram and Facebook, a multi-layered approach is essential. Here are some strategies that can be employed:

1. **Advanced Link Detection and Blocking**: AI-powered systems can analyze links in real-time, comparing them against databases of known malicious URLs, phishing sites, and content related to illegal activities. This includes detecting newly created or obfuscated links that try to bypass filters.

2. **Content Analysis and Filtering**: AI can analyze text, images, and videos accompanying links to identify potentially harmful content, even if the link itself isn't flagged. This includes detecting keywords, patterns, and visual cues associated with criminal activity.

3. **User Reporting and Moderation**: Empowering users to report suspicious links and content is crucial. Combine this with robust moderation teams and AI tools to prioritize and quickly address reported content.

4. **Account Restrictions and Bans**: Accounts repeatedly sharing criminal links should face consequences, ranging from temporary restrictions to permanent bans. Clear policies and enforcement are vital.

5. **Collaboration and Information Sharing**: Platforms should share information about detected criminal links and tactics with each other and law enforcement. This helps stay ahead of evolving threats.

6. **Education and Awareness**: User education campaigns can help people recognize and avoid clicking on suspicious links, as well as encourage responsible online behavior. This includes promoting digital literacy and critical thinking.

7. **Privacy-Preserving Data Analysis**: Techniques like differential privacy allow platforms to analyze user data for patterns related to criminal link sharing without compromising individual privacy.

8. **Proactive Threat Intelligence**: Platforms need to actively monitor and anticipate emerging threats, including new methods used by criminals to spread malicious links. This involves staying informed about trends in cybercrime and online criminal communities.

9. **Robust API Security**: Secure APIs are essential to prevent unauthorized access and manipulation of data.
